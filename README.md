# razorpay-kit
A lightweight, drop-in toolkit for Razorpay: order creation, signature/webhook verification, and small client helpers to open Razorpay Checkout. Works across Next.js, React, Vanilla JS, Express, Bun and any Node 18+ environment — the package separates server-side functionality (requires secrets) from client-side helpers (no secrets).
